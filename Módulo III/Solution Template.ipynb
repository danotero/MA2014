    "Let us represent the enviroment in which the robot roams around by a grid. Each square of the grid is either free or occupied, in which case we are talking about a position that the robot can not visit. Let $X_k$ be the position of the robot at time $t_k$. Given the latter, all the possible states of $X_k$ are the free spots of the grid: $S\\{s_1,s_2,\\dots,s_n\\}$, where $n$ is the number of free squares. Speaking of \"free squares,\" suppose we do not know where the robot is, so $P(X_0)=1/n$, $\\forall s_i\\in S$. Also, let $\\text{neighnors}(s)$ be the set of empty squares adjacent to $s$ and let $N(s)$ be the size of this set. Then, the transition model of a robot that moves to any adjacent and empty square with equal probability is given by\n",

We will assume all the possible directions are North (N), East (E), West (W) and South (S). Further, there is a sensor error rate $\\epsilon$ and errors occur independently in the four sensor directions. For instance, the probability of getting all four measurements right is $(1-\\epsilon)^4$, the probability of getting them all wrong is $\\epsilon^4$. Given this, we have that there are 16 possible measurements for $E_k$ at a given time $t_k$. Also, let $d_{ik}$ be the discrepancy: the number of bits that are different from the true bits for the square $s_i$. Then, the probability that a robot in square $s_i$ would get a reading $e_k$ is equal to\n",
